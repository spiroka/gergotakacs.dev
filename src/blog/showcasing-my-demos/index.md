I have a [repository of my various demos and experiments](https://github.com/spiroka/demos) that I wanted to showcase on my website. I wanted to keep these separate from and agnostic of my site code. For this I needed a set of constraints that each demo follows, that are flexible enough to allow me to build them any way I want.
